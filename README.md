# Computer-Vision
This is my project Computer Vision 
Here are two folders: object counting and object tracking.

## object tracking
* I used roboflow to process the data and train the model because there was so much data that the local machine couldn't do it.
* The data set was trained on more than 10,000 images with all kinds of environments (bright, dark, rainy,...)
* Data is collected from many sources (on the web, self-collected on highways...)

## object counting
* Read more carefully in the readme in the object_counting folder
